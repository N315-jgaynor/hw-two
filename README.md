This assignment worked with creating a hamburger menu to accomodate a smaller screen when working with mobile applications. I encountered a couple problems, most notably getting the positioning right for the navigation menu to drop down beneath the logo and hamburger icon.

I also learned how to create thumbnail images for a gallery using Photoshop. Using mixins I was easily able to effectively copy/paste the styling of the boxes for more streamlined code.
